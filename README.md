# oocgcm
#### Out of core analysis tools for general circulation models in python.

This project provides tools for post-processing and **analyzing** output of
**general circulation models** (based on the Arakawa C-grid) and **gridded satellite data**.

Our aim is to simplify the analysis of **very large datasets of model output**
(~1-100Tb) like those produced by basin-to-global scale [sub-mesoscale permitting
ocean models](http://meom-group.github.io/swot-natl60/) and 
[ensemble simulations of eddying ocean models](http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/?Project=ANR-13-BS06-0007) 
by **leveraging the potential of [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) and
[dask](https://github.com/dask/dask)** python packages.

The project is so far mostly targeting [NEMO](http://www.nemo-ocean.eu/)
ocean model and gridded ocean satellite data (AVISO, SST, ocean color...)
but we try to build a framework that can be used for other ocean models as well.
The framework can also be used for C-grid atmospheric general
circulation models.

#### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/lesommer/oocgcm.git
cd oocgcm
python setup.py install
```

#### Status
The project is in pre-alpha phase. More information can be found on the
project [documentation]( http://oocgcm.rtfd.io) and on the project [wiki](https://github.com/lesommer/oocgcm/wiki).
Ideas, comments and contributions are welcome !!
