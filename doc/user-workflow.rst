.. currentmodule:: oocgcm

Adapted to different usage
==========================

We would like oocgcm to be generic enough not to impose to strictly a particular
workflow to the end user.

oocgcm can be used interactively in ipython or jupyter notebooks.

oocgcm can also be used for building individual python scripts that read and
write collections of netcdf files (a la nco).
