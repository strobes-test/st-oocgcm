Tools for simplifying I/O
=========================

Currently oocgcm provides tools that simplify the creation of xarray.DataArray
from a physical database (structured collection of netcdf files).

oocgcm will soon provide tools that facilitate  the creation of physical database
resulting from analysis performed with oocgcm, following particular conventions
(eg for instance DRAKKAR conventions).
